            "\n",
            "(John): While it's true that short term trading can be risky due to the volatility of the market, it's not accurate to say that it cannot generate consistent profits. There are many professional traders who make a living from short term trading. However, it requires a deep understanding of the market, a solid strategy, and strict discipline. On the other hand, long term investing is a strategy that relies on the power of compounding returns and the general upward trend of the market over time. It's a strategy that requires patience and a tolerance for market fluctuations, but it has proven to be successful for many investors. I believe that both strategies can be profitable, but they require different skills and mindsets. It's important for each individual to understand their own risk tolerance and investment goals before deciding on a strategy.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "(Mathew): John, you're correct that short-term trading requires a deep understanding of the market, a solid strategy, and strict discipline. There are indeed successful short-term traders who make a living from it. They are well-versed in understanding market fundamentals and are attuned to events that cause short-term market moves. They use techniques such as trading based on news, using stop-loss orders, and establishing profit-taking points to manage risk. They also employ various strategies like momentum trading, range trading, breakout trading, and reversal trading. So, while short-term trading is inherently risky due to market volatility, it can indeed generate consistent profits for those who master these techniques and strategies.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "(John): Mathew, you've rightly pointed out the various strategies employed by short-term traders. However, it's important to note that while these strategies can be profitable, the success rate of short-term trading is generally low. A study showed that traders who held positions for less than a day had an average yearly profit of 14.4%, and day trading penny stocks has a success rate of about 1%. This suggests that while it's possible to make profits through short-term trading, it's not easy and the majority of traders may not be successful. On the other hand, long-term investing, while requiring patience, has historically shown to yield positive returns over time. This is why I advocate for a long-term investment strategy.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "(Mathew): John, while it's true that the success rate of short-term trading can be lower compared to long-term investing, it's important to note that this doesn't necessarily mean it's not a viable strategy. The success of a trader often depends on their skill, knowledge, and discipline, not just the strategy they use. Moreover, trading has a number of hidden costs which can make it less profitable for most traders than sticking to an investing approach. However, for those who are well-versed in the market and can effectively manage these costs, short-term trading can indeed be profitable. It's also worth noting that long-term investments like stocks often involve higher risk as they aim to ride out market volatility over extended periods. So, both strategies have their own risks and rewards, and it ultimately comes down to an individual's risk tolerance, investment goals, and expertise.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "(John): Mathew, you've made some valid points about the potential profitability of short-term trading for those who are well-versed in the market. However, it's important to consider the higher odds of success with long-term investing. As per recent information, long-term investing has a much higher likelihood of success than short-term trading. This is largely due to the fact that most individual stocks underperform the market and stock market indexes are driven higher by a small percentage of massive long-term investments. Additionally, trading has hidden costs that can make it less profitable for most traders than sticking to an investing approach. While both strategies have their own risks and rewards, it's crucial to consider these factors when deciding on an investment strategy.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "(Mathew): John, I appreciate your points on the higher odds of success with long-term investing. However, it's important to remember that 'success' in investing or trading is subjective and depends on individual goals and risk tolerance. While it's true that long-term investing has historically shown a higher likelihood of success, this doesn't negate the potential profitability of short-term trading for those who are skilled and knowledgeable. In fact, short-term trading can offer opportunities for significant profits in a shorter time frame, which can be appealing to certain individuals. It's also worth noting that both short-term trading and long-term investing come with their own unique risks and costs. For instance, long-term investments like stocks often involve higher risk as they aim to ride out market volatility over extended periods. On the other hand, short-term trading has hidden costs that can impact profitability. Therefore, it's crucial for each individual to understand these factors and choose a strategy that aligns with their personal investment goals and risk tolerance.\n",
